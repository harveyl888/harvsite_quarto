## Introduction

We have a New Year tradition of a balloon pop for the kids.  We blow up a number of balloons, each containing a piece of paper with a fun game or activity.  Throughout New Year's Eve we pop a balloon every half hour and the kids enjoy the surprise.  Of course, it's much more fun to build this in Quarto so here we go.  The repo is available at [https://github.com/harveyl888/newyear](https://github.com/harveyl888/newyear).

## Balloon Pop Quarto

The concept is simple.  Inside each balloon is a QR code instead of an activity.  The QR code points to an entry on a Quarto blog.  Kids pop a balloon, scan the code, and the fun activity pops up.  There's a distinct advantage to this approach over the old paper method - by decoupling the activity from the balloon we can easily change the activity (by updating the blog) without having to destroy the balloon.

## QR Codes

Generating QR codes is fairly straightforward with the {qrcodes} package.  The following Quarto file generates a QR code for each entry in the `posts` folder.  It reads the websites's `site-url` parameter from `_quarto.yml`, construct's each post's URL, generates the QR code and outputs the codes to a page on the site (see example at [https://harveyl888.github.io/newyear/QRcodes.html](https://harveyl888.github.io/newyear/QRcodes.html)).

```{{r}}
#| label: build_codes
#| echo: false
#| results: asis

quarto_yaml <- yaml::read_yaml("_quarto.yml")
url <- quarto_yaml$website$`site-url`
posts <- list.files("posts")

cat("::: {#fig-QR layout-ncol=3}\n")

for (i in seq_along(posts)) {
  # generate a QR code
  qr <- qrcode::qr_code(file.path(url, "posts", posts[i]))

  # save QR code as svg
  f <- file.path("qr_svg", sprintf("f%02i.svg", i))
  qrcode::generate_svg(qr, filename = f, show = FALSE, size = 200)

  # get title and add as label
  post_yaml <- rmarkdown::yaml_front_matter(file.path("posts", posts[i], "index.qmd"))
  cat(paste0("![", post_yaml$title,  "](", f, ")\n\n"))
}

cat("QR Codes\n\n:::\n")

```

## Extensions

One of the great things about Quarto is the ability to write extensions.  I added two simple shortcode extensions for a game of charades and to give a list of tongue-twisters.  Quarto extensions are written in lua but, in this case, the extensions simply take some parameters from the post header and build a button, passing the parameters to a javascript function.  The extensions can be found at [https://github.com/harveyl888/newyear/tree/main/_extensions/newyear](https://github.com/harveyl888/newyear/tree/main/_extensions/newyear).

## Conclusion

Overall, a fun, simple idea which only took a few hours to put together from scratch.
