magrittr is the pipe, commonly used in tidyverse packages, that enables simple sequencing of operators.  The simple forward pipe replaces `f(x, y)` with `x %>% f(y)`.  Code becomes much more readable when chaining multiple pipes together.  
Itâ€™s very simple to use this in any package.  the `usethis` package provides a command `usethis::use_pipe()` which takes care of everything for you.  Once run, the magrittr pipe operator will be exported and available for users.

```{r}
#| echo: false
# include magrittr for execution in post
library(magrittr)
```

```{r}
add_number <- function(x, y) {
  return(x + y)
}

3 %>% 
  add_number(5) %>% 
  add_number(2)
```
