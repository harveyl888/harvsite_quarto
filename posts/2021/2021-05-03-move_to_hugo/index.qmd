I don't know why this took so long but I finally switched this blog from Jekyll to Hugo.  Not that there's anything wrong with Jekyll but I've been experimenting with Hugo a lot over the last year and I feel more comfortable with it.  This is built on the [clarity](https://github.com/chipzoller/hugo-clarity) theme, a beautiful theme for blogging.
