title: "About Me"
---

I'm a passionate data scientist who works in the Pharmaceutical Industry. I love both science and technology and the blurry interface between them.

I spent many years at Sanofi working in areas such as property prediction, laboratory automation and omics biomarker analysis. I am currently working at Novartis as a data scientist within biostatistics.

I also help run [R/Pharma](https://rinpharma.com/), an organization dedicated to promoting data science (primarily through R) within the Pharma and Biotech industries.

I've been programming for around 40 years now and have experience in more than 20 languages and many operating systems, including several extinct ones! Currently, much of my programming favors R with python thrown in where applicable.
